# Car Evaluation PCA Visualization

This project performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the [Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation) and visualizes the results using Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the categorical car evaluation data.
- Applies manual PCA (no scikit-learn required).
- Visualizes the data in 2D using the first two principal components.
- Includes biplots to show feature contributions.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `car.data` from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Place the file in the `carEvol/` directory as `carEvol/car.data`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
3.     Run the script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. The script will display PCA scatter plots and biplots.
